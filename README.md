# triangluate-rs-egui

This repository is a fork of [eframe_template](https://deps.rs/repo/github/emilk/eframe_template). This app is based on [egui's painting demo](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/painting.rs).

The goal is to accomplish the task of my Computational Geometry course sololy with rust.

This project is still working in progress, ^w^.
